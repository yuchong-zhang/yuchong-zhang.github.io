This collection includes some interesting applications that leverage different modules and functionalities of Python. Many of these ideas come from the tutorial of Corey Schafer (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5'>Youtube link</a>), which I strongly recommend for those who are interested in learning Python or those who want to know more about the capabilities of Python. From the tutorial, I learn OOP, web scraping, database connection and many others. For practicing purpose, I play with those concepts or tools and write applications like airline/hotel accounts management and paper citation auto-check on this playground.
