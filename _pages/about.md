Hi! I’m Yuchong.

## My work and research
I am a data scientist.

## Being a lifelong learner
There is an old saying in Chinese, "吾生而有涯，而知也无涯". Tranlated into English, it means that one's lift has a limit but knowledge has none. I grew up with my favorite subject being maths, and actually, I was doing fine with it. I took training in advanced maths during my high school and won some national or regional maths competitions. Stepping into colledge, I decided to learn something more practical, and chemistry seemed to be the magic wand where you could get something out of nothing, well, if not for breaking bad.

## The other side of me
I love basketball.
