2018-01-04	Modeling Thermodynamic Properties of Isomeric Alkanes with a New Branched Equation of State	Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research	"In this paper we present an extension of the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) for branched molecules with a Lennard-Jones dimer reference fluid (SAFTD-LJ-Branch). The theory successfully predicts how branched architecture affects the attraction and repulsion between molecules. SAFTD-LJBranch takes a form similar to SAFTD-LJ with an additional parameter NB introduced to account for the branching effect. We propose an approach relating NB to the number of different types of articulation segments. The theory is used to study the effect of chain architecture on the thermodynamic properties of isomeric alkanes. SAFTD-LJ-Branch accurately predicts the phase diagram of pure butane, pentane or hexane isomers. Further, vapor pressures of n-triacontane and squalane are predicted without further fitting and shown to be in semiquantitative agreement with experimental data. Finally, SAFTD-LJ-Branch is demonstrated to be well applicable to mixtures as we model the vapor?liquid coexistence of binary alkane mixtures containing different hexane isomers and recover the experimental trends."

2018-08-14	Density functional study of dendrimer molecules in solvents of varying quality	the Journal of chemical physics	"Modified inhomogeneous statistical associating fluid theory (iSAFT) density functional theory is extended to dendrimer molecules in solvents of varying quality. The detailed structures of isolated dendrimers in implicit solvent are calculated and have a semi-quantitative agreement with simulation results available in the literature. The dendrimers form dense-core structures under all conditions, while their radius of gyration follows different scaling laws. Factors that affect the quality of the solvent are systematically studied in the explicit solvent case. It is found that the solvent size, density, chemical affinity and temperature all play a role in determining a solvent to be good or poor. New molecular dynamics simulations are performed to validate the iSAFT results. Our results provide insight into the phase behavior of dendrimer solutions as well as guidance in practical applications."	"Zhang, Yuchong, Arjun Valiya Parambathu, and Walter G. Chapman.

2019-07-23	Modeling Lower Critical Solution Temperature Behavior of Associating Dendrimers Using Density Functional Theory	Langmuir	"We study the phase behavior of associating dendrimers in explicit solvents using classical density functional theory. The existence of association enables uptake of solvent inside the dendrimer even for unfavorable Lennard-Jones interaction between the solvent and dendrimer. Depending on the distributions of associating sites, the dendrimer conformation can be either dense-core or dense-shell. The conformation of the associating dendrimer is greatly affected by the temperature. Due to the interplay between association interaction and Lennard-Jones attractions, we find the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of dendrimer conformation and study how it changes as the dendrimer size or solvent size changes. The dendrimer in our study displays no LCST behavior at low generations, and it has a maximum LCST at G4. Moreover, increasing the solvent chain length decreases the LCST. For solvents with self-association, the competition between solvent-solvent association and solvent-dendrimer association also tends to reduce the LCST. Qualitatively consistent with experiments, our results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of the LCST behavior of associating dendrimers."	"Zhang, Yuchong, and Walter G. Chapman.

2020-03-06	An Efficient Algorithm for Molecular Density Functional Theory in Cylindrical Geometry: Application to Interfacial Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (iSAFT)	Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research	"In this work, we present an efficient numerical algorithm for the solution of molecular density functional theory (DFT) in cylindrical geometry to facilitate the study of how curvature affects the microstructure and phase behavior of inhomogeneous fluids. The new solution algorithm is shown to have a better time scaling than the elliptic function method by Malijevsky [J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 126, 134710] and the transform method by Lado [J. Comput. Phys. 1971, 8, 417?433]. Convergence, performance, and stability of the numerical algorithm are discussed. We showcase two representative applications of the new method for modeling fluid adsorption and bottlebrush polymers using a specific DFT, interfacial statistical associating fluid theory (iSAFT). By comparing iSAFT with molecular simulation results, we found that iSAFT predicts layering transitions above the triple point for methane adsorption, and it captures power-law to parabolic transitions for polymer brush microstructure."

2020-05-23	Density functional study of one-and two-component bottlebrush molecules in solvents of varying quality	Molecular Physics	"Modified inhomogeneous statistical associating fluid theory (iSAFT) density functional theory is extended to bottlebrush polymers in both good and poor solvent. The detailed structures of side chains in the implicit solvent are calculated and have a semi-quantitative agreement with simulation. The average brush heights calculated from the theory agree with well-established scaling theories. iSAFT is easily extended to model bottlebrush polymers with two or more components. For an amphiphilic core-shell bottlebrush polymer, if the solvent-phobic block is much shorter than the solvent-philic block, it will fold towards the backbone even though it resides at the free end of the side chain. Similarly, for an amphiphilic mixed-type bottlebrush polymer, the chain length of different components has a great impact on the structure and properties of the molecule. The molecule may not have the response (the switch of outer layer) towards the solvent treatment if one component is significantly longer than the other. Our results provide insight into the conformation of bottlebrush polymers as well as guidance in practical applications."	"Zhang, Yuchong, et al.
